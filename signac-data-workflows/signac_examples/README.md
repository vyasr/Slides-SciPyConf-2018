# About
This repository contains the examples used during the ``signac`` presentation at SciPy 2018, the 17th annual Scientific Computing with Python conference.
The root of the repository contains a notebook that links to two example projects.
The first is a simple example demonstrating how ``signac`` can be used to manage a data space.
The second notebook contains examples of how ``signac`` can be integrated with some other tools in the Python ecosystem.
